Their basic feature is that they have a thermal form and thus lead to a quasi-thermodynamic problem with a certain free-particle Hamiltonian. We discuss the derivation of this result, the character of the Hamiltonian and its eigenstates, the single-particle spectra and the full spectra, the resulting entanglement and in particular the entanglement entropy. This is done for various one-and two-dimensional situations …},

It has been revealed that when applied to one-dimensional (1D) critical systems, the SSD realizes the translationally-invariant ground state which is the same as that of the uniform periodic system. In this paper, we propose a simple theory to explain how the SSD …},
